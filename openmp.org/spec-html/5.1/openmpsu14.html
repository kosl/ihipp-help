<p>The following rules guarantee an observable completion order for a given pair of memory operations in
race-free programs, as seen by all affected threads. If both memory operations are strong flushes, the
affected threads are all threads on devices in both of their respective device-sets. If exactly one of the
memory operations is a strong flush, the affected threads are all threads on devices in its device-set.
Otherwise, the affected threads are all threads.

<p>behave as though operations on shared variables were simply interleaved in an order consistent with the
order in which they are performed by each thread. The relaxed consistency model is invisible for such
programs, and any explicit flush operations in such programs are redundant.

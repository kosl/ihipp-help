<p>OpenMP supports thread synchronization with the use of release flushes and acquire flushes. For
any such synchronization, a release flush is the source of the synchronization and an acquire
flush is the sink of the synchronization, such that the release flush <span class="emph">synchronizes with</span> the acquire
flush.
</p> 
<p>A release flush has one or more associated <span class="emph">release sequences</span> that define the set of modifications that may be
used to establish a synchronization. A release sequence starts with an atomic operation that follows the
release flush and modifies a shared variable and additionally includes any read-modify-write atomic
operations that read a value taken from some modification in the release sequence. The following rules
determine the atomic operation that starts an associated release sequence.
</p>

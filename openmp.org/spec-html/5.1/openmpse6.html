<p>The OpenMP API defines constructs that operate in the context of the base language that is
supported by an implementation. If the implementation of the base language does not support a
language construct that appears in this document, a compliant OpenMP implementation is not
required to support it, with the exception that for Fortran, the implementation must allow case
insensitivity for directive and API routines names, and must allow identifiers of more than six
characters. An implementation of the OpenMP API is compliant if and only if it compiles and
executes all other conforming programs, and supports the tool interface, according to the syntax
and semantics laid out in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Appendices A and B as well as sections
designated as Notes (see Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="openmpse8.html#x29-280001.8">1.8<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:Organization of this document --></a>) are for information purposes only and are not part of the
specification.
                                                                            
                                                                            
</p> 
<p>All library, intrinsic and built-in routines provided by the base language must be thread-safe in a compliant
implementation. In addition, the implementation of the base language must also be thread-safe. For
example, <span class="textbf"><span class="texttt">ALLOCATE</span></span> and <span class="textbf"><span class="texttt">DEALLOCATE</span></span> statements must be thread-safe in Fortran. Unsynchronized
concurrent use of such routines by different threads must produce correct results (although not
necessarily the same as serial execution results, as in the case of random number generation
routines).
</p> 
<p>Starting with Fortran 90, variables with explicit initialization have the <span class="textbf"><span class="texttt">SAVE</span></span> attribute implicitly. This is not
the case in Fortran 77. However, a compliant OpenMP Fortran implementation must give such a variable the
<span class="textbf"><span class="texttt">SAVE</span></span> attribute, regardless of the underlying base language version.

<p>Appendix&#x00A0;<a 
href="openmpap1.html#x348-523000A">A<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:OpenMP Implementation-Defined Behaviors --></a> lists certain aspects of the OpenMP API that are implementation defined. A compliant
implementation must define and document its behavior for each of the items in Appendix&#x00A0;<a 
href="openmpap1.html#x348-523000A">A<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:OpenMP Implementation-Defined Behaviors --></a>.

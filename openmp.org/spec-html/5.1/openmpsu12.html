<p>The memory model has relaxed-consistency because a thread&#8217;s temporary view of memory is not required
to be consistent with memory at all times. A value written to a variable can remain in the thread&#8217;s temporary
view until it is forced to memory at a later time. Likewise, a read from a variable may retrieve the value
from the thread&#8217;s temporary view, unless it is forced to read from memory. OpenMP flush operations are
used to enforce consistency between a thread&#8217;s temporary view of memory and memory, or between
multiple threads&#8217; view of memory.
</p> 
<p>A flush operation has an associated <span class="emph">device-set</span> that constrains the threads with which it enforces memory
consistency. Consistency is only guaranteed to be enforced between the view of memory of its thread and
the view of memory of other threads executing on devices in its device-set. Unless otherwise stated, the
device-set of a flush operation only includes the current device.
</p> 
<p>If a flush operation is a strong flush, it enforces consistency between a thread&#8217;s temporary view and
memory. A strong flush operation is applied to a set of variables called the <span class="emph">flush-set</span>. A strong
flush restricts reordering of memory operations that an implementation might otherwise do.
Implementations must not reorder the code for a memory operation for a given variable, or the code for a
flush operation for the variable, with respect to a strong flush operation that refers to the same
variable.
</p> 
<p>If a thread has performed a write to its temporary view of a shared variable since its last strong flush of that
variable, then when it executes another strong flush of the variable, the strong flush does not complete until
the value of the variable has been written to the variable in memory. If a thread performs multiple writes
to the same variable between two strong flushes of that variable, the strong flush ensures that
the value of the last write is written to the variable in memory. A strong flush of a variable
executed by a thread also causes its temporary view of the variable to be discarded, so that if its
next memory operation for that variable is a read, then the thread will read from memory and
capture the value in its temporary view. When a thread executes a strong flush, no later memory
operation by that thread for a variable involved in that strong flush is allowed to start until the strong
flush completes. The completion of a strong flush executed by a thread is defined as the point
at which all writes to the flush-set performed by the thread before the strong flush are visible
in memory to all other threads, and at which that thread&#8217;s temporary view of the flush-set is
discarded.
</p> 
<p>A strong flush operation provides a guarantee of consistency between a thread&#8217;s temporary view and
memory. Therefore, a strong flush can be used to guarantee that a value written to a variable by one thread
may be read by a second thread. To accomplish this, the programmer must ensure that the second thread has
not written to the variable since its last strong flush of the variable, and that the following sequence of events
are completed in this specific order:

<p>If a flush operation is a release flush or acquire flush, it can enforce consistency between the views
of memory of two synchronizing threads. A release flush guarantees that any prior operation
that writes or reads a shared variable will appear to be completed before any operation that
writes or reads the same shared variable and follows an acquire flush with which the release
flush synchronizes (see Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="openmpsu13.html#x22-210001.4.5">1.4.5<!--tex4ht:ref: subsec:happens-before --></a> for more details on flush synchronization). A release
flush will propagate the values of all shared variables in its temporary view to memory prior to
the thread performing any subsequent atomic operation that may establish a synchronization.
An acquire flush will discard any value of a shared variable in its temporary view to which
the thread has not written since last performing a release flush, and it will load any value of a
shared variable propagated by a release flush that synchronizes with it into its temporary view so
that it may be subsequently read. Therefore, release and acquire flushes may also be used to
guarantee that a value written to a variable by one thread may be read by a second thread. To
accomplish this, the programmer must ensure that the second thread has not written to the variable
since its last acquire flush, and that the following sequence of events happen in this specific
order:

is possible but is not recommended because the proper timing of flushes is difficult.

<p>The flush properties that define whether a flush operation is a strong flush, a release flush, or an acquire
flush are not mutually disjoint. A flush operation may be a strong flush and a release flush; it may be a
strong flush and an acquire flush; it may be a release flush and an acquire flush; or it may be all
three.

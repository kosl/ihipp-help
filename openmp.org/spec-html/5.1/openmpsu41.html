<p>When a thread encounters a <span class="textbf"><span class="texttt">parallel</span></span> directive without a <span class="textbf"><span class="texttt">proc_bind</span></span> clause, the <span class="textit"><span class="textrm">bind-var</span></span> ICV is used
to determine the policy for assigning OpenMP threads to places within the current place partition, that is,
within the places listed in the <span class="textit"><span class="textrm">place-partition-var</span></span> ICV for the implicit task of the encountering thread. If the
<span class="textbf"><span class="texttt">parallel</span></span> directive has a <span class="textbf"><span class="texttt">proc_bind</span></span> clause then the binding policy specified by the <span class="textbf"><span class="texttt">proc_bind</span></span>
clause overrides the policy specified by the first element of the <span class="textit"><span class="textrm">bind-var</span></span> ICV. Once a thread in
the team is assigned to a place, the OpenMP implementation should not move it to another
place.
</p> 
<p>The <span class="textbf"><span class="texttt">primary</span></span> thread affinity policy instructs the execution environment to assign every thread in the team
to the same place as the primary thread. The place partition is not changed by this policy, and each implicit
task inherits the <span class="textit"><span class="textrm">place-partition-var</span></span> ICV of the parent implicit task. The <span class="textbf"><span class="texttt">master</span></span> thread-affinity
policy, which has been deprecated, has identical semantics to the <span class="textbf"><span class="texttt">primary</span></span> thread affinity
policy.
</p> 
<p>The <span class="textbf"><span class="texttt">close</span></span> thread affinity policy instructs the execution environment to assign the threads in the team to
places close to the place of the parent thread. The place partition is not changed by this policy, and each
implicit task inherits the <span class="textit"><span class="textrm">place-partition-var</span></span> ICV of the parent implicit task. If <span 
class="cmmi-10">T </span>is the number of threads in
the team, and <span 
class="cmmi-10">P </span>is the number of places in the parent&#8217;s place partition, then the assignment of threads in the
team to places is as follows:

<p>The purpose of the <span class="textbf"><span class="texttt">spread</span></span> thread affinity policy is to create a sparse distribution for a team of <span 
class="cmmi-10">T </span>threads
among the <span 
class="cmmi-10">P </span>places of the parent&#8217;s place partition. A sparse distribution is achieved by first
subdividing the parent partition into <span 
class="cmmi-10">T </span>subpartitions if <span 
class="cmmi-10">T </span><span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span><span 
class="cmmi-10">P </span>, or <span 
class="cmmi-10">P </span>subpartitions if <span 
class="cmmi-10">T &#x003E; P </span>.
Then one thread (<span 
class="cmmi-10">T </span><span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x2264; </span><span 
class="cmmi-10">P </span>) or a set of threads (<span 
class="cmmi-10">T &#x003E; P </span>) is assigned to each subpartition. The
<span class="textit"><span class="textrm">place-partition-var</span></span> ICV of each implicit task is set to its subpartition. The subpartitioning is not only a
mechanism for achieving a sparse distribution, it also defines a subset of places for a thread
to use when creating a nested <span class="textbf"><span class="texttt">parallel</span></span> region. The assignment of threads to places is as
